Welcome to CircularEconomy-MassFlowCalculator's documentation!
==============================================================

Circular Economy - Mass Flow Calculator (CE-MFC) is a NREL supported tool to help quantify and assign a value framework to efforts on re-design, reduction, replacement, reusage, recycling, and lifetime and reliability increases on PV, implementing Circular Economy metrics for PV materials.

The CE-MFC leverages published data from different sources on PV manufacturing and predicted technological changes.

This tool will help implement circularity metrics, quantify and assign a value framework to efforts on re-design, reduction, replacement, reusage, recycling, and lifetime and reliability increases on PV.

The intended audience ranges from PV performance and analyst researchers, Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) companies, installers, investors, consumers and analysts of the PV industry interested in predicting and evaluating the impact of PV growth in our environment and how the improvements towards Circularity affect waste.

The source code for CE-MFC is hosted on `github
<https://github.com/NREL/CircularEconomy-MassFlowCalculator>`_.

Please see the :ref:`installation` page for installation help.
