# # (baseline development) Silicon per M2 Calculations

# This journal documents the methods and assumptions made to create a baseline material file for silicon.

# ## Mass per M2

# The mass of silicon contained in a PV module is dependent on the size, thickness and number of cells in an average module. Since there is a range of sizes and number of cells per module, we will attempt a weighted average. These weighted averages are based on ITRPV data, which goes back to 2010.
