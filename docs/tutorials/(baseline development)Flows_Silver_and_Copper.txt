Silver and Copper Baseline Flows Assumptions

See the Jupyter Journal for the derivation of g/m^2 of module of both silver and copper.

Based on a 2003 book about copper flows and impacts, they state the global average is 125 tons of ore are mined to generate 1 ton of copper ore, or 0.8% efficiency at the mine mouth (excluding overburden). The SX-EW process is slightly more efficient, but constitutes a small but growing marketshare (<15%). The roasting and smelting processes result in slag with 0.5% to 10% copper content, some of which can be recovered by secondary processes; we will assume 5% losses during roasting and smelting (or 95% efficiency). Therefore, we assume a 76% virgin material efficiency for copper, which falls between the 62% and 88% efficiency as noted in the copper refining book from 2003. R. U. Ayres, L. W. Ayres, and I. Råde, The Life Cycle of Copper, Its Co-Products and Byproducts. Dordrecht: Springer Netherlands, 2003.

The mining efficiency of silver, excluding overburden, is 80%, from 2002 data (T. Lanzano, M. Bertram, M. De Palo, C. Wagner, K. Zyla, and T. E. Graedel, “The contemporary European silver cycle,” Resources, Conservation and Recycling, vol. 46, no. 1, pp. 27–43, Jan. 2006, doi: 10.1016/j.resconrec.2005.06.003.). In the furnaces from various types of ores is approximately 95% recoverable (W. C. Butterman and H. E. Hilliard, “Silver,” USGS, Open-File Report 2004-1251, 2005. [Online]. Available: https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1251/.). A USGS 2009 Report indicates that 70% to 95% of silver is recoverable from various ore types (T. G. Goonan, “The Lifecycle of Silver in the United States in 2009,” USGS, Scientific Investigations Report Scientific Investigations Report 2013–5178, 2014. [Online]. Available: https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2013/5178/.). Finally, silver is often recovered from copper ores. Therefore, We assume a 75% virgin material efficiency for silver.

We assume 80% manufacturing efficiency of silver, based on the overproduction of solar cells with silver on them (11% more cells than installed capacity) (C. Alexander et al., “World Silver Survey 2019,” The Silver Institute, Apr. 2019.), plus any additional processing inefficiencies, such as screen cleaning losses.

We assume that 95% of the silver used in the manufacturing process is collected and sent to a recycler (accounting for non-recoverable processing inefficiencies). We assume that the recycling efficiency is the US industry average of 97% efficient (H. E. Hilliard, “Silver Recycling in the United States in 2000,” U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY CIRCULAR 1196-N, 2000.)

For Copper, we assume a 90% manufacturing efficiency, since the primary manufacturing waste would be trimmed tabbing and cabling.

Globally and in North America, only 2% of copper is lost from recycling high grade copper scrap (like PV manufacturing). Therefore, the MFG recycling efficiency will be 98% (copper flows from North America, 10/500 Mton = 2% losses). The low quality copper scrap is recycled at only a slightly lower efficiency, therefore, we will assume 95% efficiency for EoL scrap for all time (if it gets recycled). S. Hernandez, L. Yusheng, and R. Labo, “World Copper Factbook 2017,” International Copper Study Group, 2017. Accessed: Jan. 13, 2021. [Online].

Currently and historically, recycling of PV panels is minimal to non-existant. Therefore, prior to 2015, all EoL circular flows are 0. In 2014, recycling of PV panels was happening in the EU, but was failing to recover any precious metals. By 2017, this recovery percentage was up to 21.5% (K. Wambach, “Life Cycle Inventory of Current Photovoltaic Modules Recycling Process in Europe,” IEA PVPS Task 12 IEA-PVPS T12-12:2017, Dec. 2017. Accessed: Jan. 12, 2021. [Online]. Available: https://iea-pvps.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LCI_of_Current_European_PV_Recycling_WambachHeath_2017_by_Task_12.pdf.). 

Based on silver scrap refining and silver end use demand (“WORLD SILVER SURVEY 2020,” The Silver Institute, WASHINGTON, D.C., Apr. 2020.), we assumed the EoL HQ to 80%. Silver scrap refining can be binned into low, 35-80%, and high purity >80%. Solder silver purity is above 75%, so recycling into manufacutring for PV would require a High quality silver recycling process. The price per oz for the different purities is up to 20% different. We are assuming that, despite the higher price for a high quality silver, some is not recoverable to the highest quality. It is assumed that the reycler companies that try to recover the silver focus on getting high quality purity 80% of silver.

Most copper is used in electrical equipment such as wiring and motors. This is because it conducts both heat and electricity very well, and can be drawn into wires. It also has uses in construction (for example roofing and plumbing), and industrial machinery (such as heat exchangers). Most of these applications require high purity copper, and the copper industry is very large and efficient at reusing scrap. Therefore, we are assuming that 100% of recycled copper goes into high quality material.
