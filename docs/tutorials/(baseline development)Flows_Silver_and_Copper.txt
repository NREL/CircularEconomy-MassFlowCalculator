Silver and Copper Baseline Flows Assumptions

See the Jupyter Journal for the derivation of g/m^2 of module of both silver and copper.

We assume a ##% virgin material efficiency for silver??? 

Based on a 2003 book about copper flows and impacts, they state the global average is 125 tons of ore are mined to generate 1 ton of copper ore, or 0.8% efficiency at the mine mouth (excluding overburden). The SX-EW process is slightly more efficient, but constitutes a small but growing marketshare (<15%). The roasting and smelting processes result in slag with 0.5% to 10% copper content, some of which can be recovered by secondary processes; we will assume 5% losses during roasting and smelting (or 95% efficiency). Therefore, we assume a 76% virgin material efficiency for copper, which falls between the 62% and 88% efficiency as noted in the copper refining book from 2003. 

We assume 80% manufacturing efficiency of silver, based on the overproduction of solar cells with silver on them (11% more cells than installed capacity), plus any additional processing inefficiencies, such as screen cleaning losses (C. Alexander et al., “World Silver Survey 2019,” The Silver Institute, Apr. 2019.).

We assume that 100% of the silver used in the manufacturing process is collected and sent to a recycler. We assume that the recycling efficiency is the US industry average of 97% efficient (H. E. Hilliard, “Silver Recycling in the United States in 2000,” U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY CIRCULAR 1196-N, 2000.)

For Copper, we assume a 90% manufacturing efficiency, since the primary manufacturing waste would be trimmed tabbing and cabling.

Globally and in North America, only 2% of copper is lost from recycling high grade copper scrap (like PV manufacturing). Therefore, the MFG recycling efficiency will be assumed to be 98%. The low quality copper scrap is recycled at only a slightly lower efficiency, therefore, we will assume 95% efficiency for EoL scrap for all time (if it gets recycled). S. Hernandez, L. Yusheng, and R. Labo, “World Copper Factbook 2017,” International Copper Study Group, 2017. Accessed: Jan. 13, 2021. [Online].

Currently and historically, recycling of PV panels is minimal to non-existant. Therefore, prior to 2015, all EoL circular flows are 0. In 2014, recycling of PV panels was happening in the EU, but was failing to recover any precious metals. By 2017, this recovery percentage was up to 21.5% (K. Wambach, “Life Cycle Inventory of Current Photovoltaic Modules Recycling Process in Europe,” IEA PVPS Task 12 IEA-PVPS T12-12:2017, Dec. 2017. Accessed: Jan. 12, 2021. [Online]. Available: https://iea-pvps.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LCI_of_Current_European_PV_Recycling_WambachHeath_2017_by_Task_12.pdf.). We assumed a linear increase in recycling of silver and copper between 2014 and 2017.

The FRELP recycling process has been documented, and a pilot facility is in Europe. This process claims to recover silver and copper at 95% ([1]K. Wambach, “Life Cycle Inventory of Current Photovoltaic Modules Recycling Process in Europe,” IEA PVPS Task 12 IEA-PVPS T12-12:2017, Dec. 2017. Accessed: Jan. 12, 2021. [Online]. Available: https://iea-pvps.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LCI_of_Current_European_PV_Recycling_WambachHeath_2017_by_Task_12.pdf.). It is optimistically assumed that this process will be running at scale by 2025. A linear increase from 21.5%  to 95% recovery of silver and copper is assumed. Additionally, it is assumed that this increasing recycled silver stream would be routed back into PV manufacturing, given the growth projections for PV installations.
