# CircularEconomy-MassFlowCalculator

This open-source tool will help quantify and assign a value framework to efforts on re-design, reduction, replacement, reusage, recycling, and lifetime and reliability increases on PV, implementing Circular Economy metrics for PV materials.

The CE-MFC is leveraging published data from different sources on PV manufacturing and predicted technological changes. Input data is being compiled [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WV54lNAdA2uP6a0g5wMOOE9bu8nbwvnQDgLj3GuGojE/edit?usp=sharing)

This tool will help implement circularity metrics, quantify and assign a value framework to efforts on re-design, reduction, replacement, reusage, recycling, and lifetime and reliability increases on PV.
